''' execution
take string input from user
creating c variable with 0 as value because we are assuming that given string might be empty
taking string as python
iteration1: extract p from s and add to  c become 1
iteration2: extract y from s and add to c become 2
iteration3: extract t from s and add to c become 3
iteration4: extract h from s and add to c become 4
iteration5: extract o from s and add to c become 5
iteration6: extract n from s and add to c  become 6


at last print c value 6'''
